# Hi there ðŸ‘‹ I'm Caleb Johnson

Welcome to my GitHub profile! I'm an Electrical & Computer Engineering student at **Eastern Washington University** with a passion for **FPGA design**, **embedded systems**, and **hardware-software integration**. I enjoy working on projects that combine hardware and software to solve real-world problems.

### **Stepper Motor Control and Configuration**
- **Objective**: Develop a system to control and configure stepper motors for precise motion control applications.
- **Key Features**:
  - Implemented **PWM signals** for motor control.
  - Configured **microcontroller interfaces** for motor driver communication.
  - Designed a **user interface** for setting motor parameters (e.g., speed, direction, steps).
- **Tools**: C/C++, STM32 microcontroller, Arduino IDE.

### **I2C Sensor Integration (Lab 6)**
- **Objective**: Read data from an I2C temperature, pressure, and humidity sensor and display the values with units.
- **Tasks**:
  1. **Task 1**: Wire up the I2C sensor and extract data.
  2. **Task 2**: Print the values (temperature, pressure, humidity) with units using `printf`.
- **Deliverables**:
  - A well-commented `Main.c` file.
  - A narrative report explaining the technical details of the implementation.
- **Tools**: C, I2C protocol, STM32 microcontroller.

## ðŸš€ Projects

### **Traffic Light Control System (FPGA Design)**
- Designed and implemented a **traffic light control system** in **VHDL** for a simplified intersection.
- Developed a **finite state machine (FSM)** with 4 states and used a **counter** to track state durations.
- Mapped the design to an FPGA board and verified functionality using **Xilinx Vivado**.
